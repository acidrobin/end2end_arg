Comment 2 (supports main topic): Hate crime enhancements cause communities to perceive themselves as distinct and opposed

Comment 3 (supports main topic): Hate crime enhancements are unfair

Comment 4 (attacks main topic): Hate crimes deserve greater punishment

Comment 5 (attacks Comment 2): In almost every case where hate crimes are committed, the communities involved already perceive themselves as distinct and opposed, mostly because they already believe that their communities have been sundered by structural inequalities and hate-motivated crimes.

Comment 6 (attacks Comment 4): Much of this symbolism and “meaning” attributed to hate crimes is deeply subjective and open to (mis)interpretation, especially in a politicized environment where hatred against one group is perceived as being the “usual” motivation behind any crime by any individual from another community against that group, and where the idea of hatred motivating a crime against another community by a different individual (based on his own background) is treated with scepticism.

Comment 2 (supports main topic): Religions divide humanity

Comment 3 (attacks main topic): Religions provide charity

Comment 4 (attacks main topic): Religions provide succour

Comment 5 (attacks Comment 3): Religious education frequently has more to do with indoctrination than anything else, as is seen in so-called schools where reciting the Koran or Talmud passes for education or in privately funded education in the UK and US where evolution is taught as ‘just another theory’.In terms of tackling poverty, there is no doubt that many religious organisations- especially the Catholic Church- provide enormous quantities of relief to the poverty directly caused by their policies in the first place.No single cause of poverty, especially among women, is greater than denying women access to contraception, closely followed by denying them access to education.

Comment 5 (attacks Comment 3): The very fact that the only time since its creation when the superdelegates played a significant role, they managed to select the most unelectable candidate in modern American history – and by their involvement made him, more unelectable still suggests that the system may not be working.Their intervention in 1984 to nudge Mondale over the winning line produced a candidate who lost in 49 states.

Comment 4 (supports main topic): It is unethical to deny terminally ill patients access to experimental drugs

Comment 5 (attacks Comment 1): There is no reason why, under this model, you could not retain suitable precautions to ensure that this doesn’t happen.For example, you could continue the obligation for companies to sell the drug at cost (they would, naturally, continue to be incentivised by the huge profits they expect to make when the drug is licensed).

Comment 6 (attacks Comment 2): First, this may well be overridden by the individual rights of present patients (see proposition arguments).Second, the greater time taken to recruit is one that may be offset by greater numbers: whilst the trial will be of a lower quality (no control group, etc.) there will nevertheless be a greater number of people willing to take the drug (people who wouldn’t have wanted to be part of a trial, but are willing to try the new treatment).

Comment 5 (attacks Comment 4): Universities that could build valuable technologies and explore new avenues of academic research and development are faced with a disincentive to accept public funding, and to pursue unprofitable research that might be dependent on state support.

Comment 6 (attacks Comment 3): Publicly funded research is not the sole property of researchers, indeed Universities demand to keep the rights not the individual researchers so the individual inventor or researcher is not benefiting at all from any profits.
