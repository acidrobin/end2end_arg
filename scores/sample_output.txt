<s> sierpniu 18, 2018 by Ewa Szadkowska
The end of the August and the end of the summer is coming to an end. It is a great time to reflect on the previous months and evaluate the results. It is also a great opportunity to create plans for the next season.
During the summer, we have been working on new products and we are proud to present them.
We have been working on a new product for some time. It is the product that will help you to create a new home for your children. A cozy nest. A place in which you can calm your little ones so that they can sleep peacefully.
It is a baby bed that you can easily move and transform into a playhouse or a wardrobe. We are sure that your child will love it. The best thing is that it is made of eco-friendly, non-toxic materials.
We are happy that we can now introduce to you our new product – the baby bed. It’s a cozy nest. A small, mobile and eco-friendly place for your little ones.
We have created a place where they will feel comfortable, a place in which they will be able to sleep peacefully and quietly.
The product is made of beechwood and pinewood. The materials have been obtained in a natural way.
Our baby bed is a wooden toy for children from 2 to 8 years old. It can be used as a place for sleep, a playhouse or a wardrobe. It is small and can be easily moved.
The product is already available. We are waiting for your feedback.
