Comment 1: Daesh has an ideology that is a threat to western states, particularly those with Muslim minorities. Although Daesh’s ideology might seem incompatible with west the west an ICM poll found in 2014 that 16% of French citizens have a positive opinion of Daesh.[1] This means that western countries face an ideological clash within their own populations. A majority dislikes and fears Daesh and its ideology while a minority supports them despite their violence. Such a split reduces community cohesion and will likely breed distrust of Muslim populations (even of those who don’t have positive views of Daesh).[2][1] Grant, Madeline, ‘16% of French Citizens Support ISIS, Poll finds’, newsweek, 26 August 2014, http://www.newsweek.com/16-french-citizens-support-isis-poll-finds-266795[2] Hundal, Sunny, ‘The real threat from the Islamic State is to Muslims, not the west’, AlJazeera, 26 August 2014, http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/08/real-threat-from-islamic-state--201482316357532975.html

Comment 2: All western countries are insulated by distance from Islamic State. The closest western countries are Greece and Cyprus which is as close as the EU comes to Syria. But both are separated from Syria by the Mediterranean Sea. If Daesh were truly considered a threat of the kind that requires harsh national security responses then Europe could close its borders to the South and East – its borders with Turkey in particular. This has however not happened because the risk of terrorists (re-)entering Europe is not considered great enough to warrant such a response.   

Comment 3: Daesh is a terrorist organisation.[1] There are large numbers of people within Europe who support Islamic State and Europeans travelling to fight for Daesh is an ongoing problem

Comment 1: Islamic State is an ideological threat to western ideology. It is an organisation that seeks to implement a form of Islamic law in its interpretation of it that is at odds with western liberal democracy. It is therefore a threat to western ideology because it seeks to replace western ideology. It is not a threat to western countries in the

Comment 7: The threat from Daesh is being exaggerated by the media. The media is often accused of being sensationalist but in this case it is absolutely justified. The media has the responsibility to report on events that are happening in real time and there is no doubt that what is happening in the Middle East is an incredible story. The media however has a tendency to focus on the worst aspects of a story, and there is no doubt that the worst story currently occurring is in the Middle East. The media however has a duty to report on events that are happening elsewhere as well and it is clear that there is a lack of perspective on the situation in the Middle East. The media is therefore rightly accused of hyping the threat from the Middle East. [1] The media however is simply responding to the reality on the ground. The Middle East is in the midst of a humanitarian disaster and that is undeniable. It is however a disaster that is being caused by the failure of western foreign policy in the region. The US and western Europe bear responsibility for the creation of the state of Iraq and the subsequent war that was illegal and unnecessary. The west should have done more to prevent the creation of an artificial state that would later fall out of control and become a threat to the region and the west.[1] BBC News, ‘ISIS in Context’, http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24151961

Comment 8: The west is the greatest threat to the Islamic state. It is undeniable that the west is the great imperialist power of modern times. It is also undeniable that Islamic state is a reaction to western imperialism. The west is therefore the greatest threat to Islamic state because it is the west that created the state that is now a threat to the west. The west created the state that is now attacking it.
