Comment 1 (supports main topic): The internet is the last frontier of free speech

Comment 2 (attacks Comment 1): By using Twitter to signal the start of riots it attracts people to join the mob. People in riots generally look to those around them in order to see what is considered acceptable behaviour. If a riot will not disperse peacefully then the police often find they need to use batons, water cannon, or even in extremis tear gas or rubber bullets. It is the police’s duty to bring back public order by stopping riots through these methods. If during instances of rioting the police are able to prevent those rioters from encouraging their friends to join them so expanding the riots then this is the right course of action to take. If the government were to block Twitter, enterprising demonstrators would quickly find an alternative. The internet does not work, rioters will likely simply post pictures and encouragement for the next night’re rioting once the internet and mobile connections are restored as governments would have to do if they did not want to affect the law abiding majority during the day.

Comment 1 (attacks main topic): Blocking Twitter during riots is dangerous to state power

Comment 2 (attacks Comment 1): By using Twitter to signal the start of riots it attracts people to join the mob. People in riots generally look to those around them in order to see what is considered acceptable behaviour. By blocking Twitter governments are able to manage flashpoints and prevent them from expanding violence to other locations. This makes riot situations both less likely to escalate, and easier to break up. The internet is a remarkably fecund environment, one in which solutions to problems are quickly found. The freedom of speech is a critical right in all free societies precisely because it is the ultimate check ordinary citizens have to challenge the powers that be, to express dissent, and to organize with like-minded people dissatisfied with the way government is running. The government should not seek to stop that.  

 Comment 3 (attacks comment 2): The state may not be the best placed to gauge the legitimacy of riots. If riots are legitimate then they should be allowed to develop into something more than just protest and protest-related chaos.  –  – – –   – - – –

Comment 1 (supports main topic): Blocking Twitter would give the government a false beachhead of power.

Comment 2 (attacks Comment 1): By using Twitter to signal the start of riots it attracts people to join the mob. People in riots generally look to those around them in order to see what is considered acceptable behaviour. The lens through which rioters determine acceptable behaviour is expanded, so the chance of behaviours like looting rippling across the various mob groups within a locale increases. This makes riot situations both less likely to escalate, and easier to break up.

Comment 2 (attacks primary topic): Twitter can act as a ‘call to action’ to incite more crime. It is thus a serious danger to society during periods of social unrest and rioting. People in riots generally look to those around them in order to see what is considered acceptable behaviour. By blocking Twitter governments are able to manage flashpoints and prevent them from expanding violence to other locations. Furthermore, bans on child pornography would be a more effective method of preventing anti-government sentiment. 

 Comment 3 (attacks Comment 2): the state may not be the best placed to gauge the legitimacy of riots.
>>\Comment 4 (attacks main topic) Blocking social media networks during riots does not work to stop the riots. The violence will still escalate, and blocking out a website will fail to accomplish anything other than alienate Twitter users from the state and anger at its impositions.Even if bans on Twitter are successful, there is a danger that rioters will take advantage of the situation.
