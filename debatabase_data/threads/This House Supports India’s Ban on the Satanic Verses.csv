2213,This House Supports India’s Ban on the Satanic Verses,People have a right to choose their cultural values,support,Society has a right to choose and structure its values as it sees fit and there is no reason why the Western construction of values is right or should take priority over any other.In Muslim countries faith may be a more important aspect of life that it might be in Western countries and it is entirely legitimate that those societies might choose to value protecting the dignity of their faith over absolute freedom of speech. ,t529,p2213
2214,This House Supports India’s Ban on the Satanic Verses,India has a specific need to main social cohesion,support,"India’s post-independence history is one of partition along religious grounds with Pakistan and then open warfare with that state over territory.  There is still a large Muslim minority in India and there are deep underlying social tensions within the country on this basis, along with frosty relations with a nuclear-capable Pakistan.In this context, India’s leaders have a special reason to pay attention to the sensibilities of their minority populations.  If allowing the publication of The Satanic Verses would result in social unrest then on the balance of harms it is a rational choice to make a limited restriction on freedom of speech rather than see potential millions having their property and lives threatened.",t529,p2214
2215,This House Supports India’s Ban on the Satanic Verses,Freedom of Speech is a Universal Right,attack,"Freedom of speech and expression exists in any modern list of human rights.  It is a fundamental right that is necessary for any society to function properly and for individuals to achieve happiness and fulfilment in their lives.‘Hurt and outrage’ are false harms – nobody suffers any damage from being exposed to an opposing view other than what they choose to suffer based on how close-minded they are.  On the contrary, everybody has a chance to benefit when they are exposed to a foreign view or opinion, whether it be by changing their own view or being able to re-affirm their existing view in a new way.  ",t529,p2215
2213,This House Supports India’s Ban on the Satanic Verses,no summary,attack,‘Freedom of speech’ is not so much a ‘cultural value’ so much as it is a vehicle for communicating and exploring different cultural values.  ,p2213,c2213
2214,This House Supports India’s Ban on the Satanic Verses,no summary,attack,"The problem with this approach is twofold; firstly it means that because of an implicit threat of force the majority have had their rights subordinated to the preferences of a minority.  Regardless of the context of how this happens, this kind of precedent is always the first step on the road to tyranny.  Secondly it is a recipe for social stagnation; if the state acts to prevent anyone from encountering views that they disagree with or might find disturbing then their view will never change and the state will find itself forever trapped in a paradigm of conflict and stagnation.",p2214,c2214
2215,This House Supports India’s Ban on the Satanic Verses,no summary,attack,"Freedom of Speech is but one right amongst many, including freedom of religion, and they are not intrinsically ranked against each other.  The right of people to have and hold religious views without having those views demonised or insulted is a right that might easily be considered just as important.Moreover the West is often hypocritical with how it defines the right to free speech – Western countries often restrict incitement to violence or speech which is insulting to individuals, or even just when that speech is against the national interest (such as with official secrets). If it is legitimate to use state institutions such as the courts to protect individuals from insults, why is it illegitimate to use state institutions to protect religions from insults?",p2215,c2215
